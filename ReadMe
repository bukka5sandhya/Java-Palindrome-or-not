Write a Java program to find out whether the given String is Palindrome or not.

A palindrome is a number, string or a sequence which will be the same even after you reverse the order. 
For example, RACECAR, if spelled backward will be same as RACECAR.
Another example, MADAM, if spelled backward will be same as MADAM.
